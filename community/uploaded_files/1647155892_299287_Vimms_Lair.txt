For easiest use, please unzip the ROM to the same location as your Nintendo emulator.
No emulator is perfect, so if this ROM doesn't work with your favorite emulator please try it with another one.
The latest emulators can always be found in the Emulation Lair.
If you'd like to read the manual for this game, be sure to check out The Manual Project to see if it's available.
