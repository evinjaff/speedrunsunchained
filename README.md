# speedrunsunchained
 
This a rough prototype of my idea for a "speedrun" party game. The rough Alpha for this was written over my spring break at Wash U and still has a lot of fixes to be added.

## Technical summary

This application is built using two parallel applications, a community and a game that both access a common database.

I built the community application in Django. The SQLite database is directly generated by the Django models, so modification and expansion can easy be done running migration commands in Django.

The game application integrates with the SQLite database from the Django app, and is queryable via Node.js on that side. In order to protect from SQL injection, the database commands are executed on a Node.js server, and the data is transmitted upon request to the client via socket.io.

In its current phase, this is in alpha and is lacking in web security and thus has not yet been hosted online. This alpha is more of a proof-of-concept and more web security/polish is soon to come. I do NOT recommend hosting this to the world wide web yet and claim no responsibility if you get SQL injected, Hacked, or DDoS-ed. 

This application is also not very scalable in it's present state. In an ideal world, you could either build an implementation similar to Meta where you have many SQL server nodes that will "vote" on whether something exists based on their records, or use a distributed SQL server that would form one logical database to query from like Amazon Aurora.

## How to run this

The requirements to run the Django application can be found inside the community/requirements.txt file. This .txt file is just a raw export of all my Python packages from pip so if you aren't able to satisfy all the requirements you might still be fine. I would specifically make sure that you run version 4.0.2 of Django and that your installation of Python is new enough to include sqlite 3.9 (NOTE: This will become really important later). After testing enough implementations, I will eventually probably just form a wiki for this.

NOTE: For Django, I would highly recommend you use a virtual environment generated through <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">miniconda</a> or the standard python virtualenv.

As for Node.js, I surprisingly didn't have any issues. Just run npm install on the game/package.JSON file and you should be good to go.
